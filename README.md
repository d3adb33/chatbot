Summering of a chatGPT approach with tools from webdev and python frameworks:

Train a GPT model: There are a few options for training a GPT model, but one popular choice is to use the GPT-3 model provided by OpenAI. To use this model, you will need to apply for access to the OpenAI API and obtain an API key.

Set up a backend server: You will need to create a backend server that can handle requests from your web application and send them to the GPT model for processing. You can use Python and a web framework such as Flask or Django to create the server.

Develop a web interface: You will need to create a user-friendly web interface that allows users to enter text inputs and receive responses from the GPT model. You can use a frontend framework such as React, Vue.js, or Angular to create the web interface.

Integrate the frontend and backend: You will need to connect the frontend and backend components of your application so that they can communicate with each other.

Deploy the application: Once you have completed the development and testing of your application, you will need to deploy it to a server or a cloud platform so that users can access it.

There are many resources available online that can help you with each of these steps. Here are a few to get you started:

Vue.js frontend framework documentation: https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html
Angular frontend framework documentation: https://angular.io/docs

....we will see how it goes....
